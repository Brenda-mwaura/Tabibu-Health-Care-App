## Introduction

- Access to quality medical services is a fundamental right that every individual should have. However, in Kenya, there are several barriers that prevent patients from accessing the medical care they need. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), Kenya has one of the highest patient-to-doctor ratios in the world, with only one doctor per 16,000 people. This means that patients often have to wait for long periods to see a doctor, and the quality of medical services may suffer as a result. 
- In addition, a study by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) found that patients who seek medical attention at public hospitals have to wait for an average of 4 hours before being attended to, with some patients waiting for up to 8 hours. This long wait time is a significant barrier to accessing medical services, and it often leads to patients seeking care from unqualified medical practitioners, or not seeking care at all.
- Furthermore, the lack of a proper appointment booking system in hospitals is another challenge that patients face. This results in patients queuing for long hours just to book an appointment, which can be a significant problem for handicapped individuals. According to a study by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, there is an average of 70 patients per doctor in public hospitals, making it difficult for doctors to provide quality medical services.
- In addition, many patients are unaware of the small clinics around them and end up going to public hospitals, where the queues are long and waiting times can be deadly. In fact, according to a study by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, over 50% of patients who die while seeking medical services in public hospitals do so while waiting in line
- Moreover, patients in Kenya face additional challenges due to the lack of access to their medical records. The current system used in hospitals is paper-based, and hospitals retain all patient records in a file. This makes it difficult for patients to transfer their medical records to other hospitals or clinics, and it can be a tedious process for hospitals to manage these records, leading to lost or misplaced files. Additionally, there are no public hospitals in rural areas, and many small clinics in these regions are unknown to patients. This forces patients to travel long distances to access medical services, which can be a burden for those with limited resources.
- Lastly, many small clinics in Kenya close each year due to lack of patients. This is a significant concern for hospitals, clinics, and patients, as it can lead to a decrease in the availability of medical services in certain areas.
In light of these challenges, there is an urgent need to find innovative solutions that can help patients access medical services more efficiently and effectively. This is where Tabibu Health Care comes in â€“ to bridge the gap between patients and medical services, and provide a solution that can help alleviate some of the problems faced by patients in Kenya.

## Problem

- Patients in Kenya face multiple challenges when seeking medical care, including long queues and limited access to quality medical services at public hospitals, lack of access to medical records, and limited awareness of small clinics in their localities. These problems lead to delays in treatment, misdiagnosis, and potential loss of life, as well as added costs and inconvenience for patients who must travel long distances to receive medical care. 
- Furthermore, clinics struggle to attract patients, with many closing each year due to lack of demand. 

## Solution
- To address these challenges, our project aims to provide patients with a user-friendly platform to locate nearby clinics, access their medical records, and book appointments with ease.
