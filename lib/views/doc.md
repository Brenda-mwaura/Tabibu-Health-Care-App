## Detailed Description of the Solution

- As the global population increases, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention. This has led to long queues and a lot of congestion in public hospitals, resulting to patients long waiting times. The long waiting times has been perceived to act as a barrier to actually obtaining medical services.

### Objective of the solution

- To address this problem, we will be developing a system that will allow users to locate the nearest clinics and be able to book appointments at the comfort of their homes. This will help to reduce the congestion in public hospitals and also reduce the long waiting times for patients.

### Justification of the solution

- The platform will enable users to create an account and be able to login. Upon login in, the user will be able to view the nearest clinics around them. Additionally, the user will be able to view the details of the clinic including the services offered, the doctors available, and the location of the clinic on a map. The platform will also allow the user to book an appointment to the clinic of their choice and be able to get a notification when the appointment is confirmed. The user be able to view their appointments, cancel appointments and reschedule appointments. Lastly, the user will also be able to provide feedback and ratings on the clinic they visited.

## Approach

- The proposed solution will come both as a mobile application and a web application. The mobile application will be developed using Flutter and the web application will be developed using React. The backend will be developed using Django and Django Rest Framework. The lavege of using Django and Django Rest Framework is that it will allow us to develop a robust and scalable backend. The backend will be hosted on render free tier.
